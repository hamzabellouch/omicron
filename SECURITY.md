## Security Notes

Omicron uses isolated internal environments for its download engines and does not require external applications such as Termux to function.

The application currently relies on:
- `yt-dlp` for video, audio, and playlist downloading
- `gallery-dl` for image downloading

Users are strongly encouraged to keep both the application and download engines updated to receive the latest fixes and security improvements.
